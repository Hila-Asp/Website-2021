                    Hello And Welcome To My Page! <br />
                    My Name Is Hila And I Am The Face Behind "My Dress".<br />
                    Since A Young Age I Knew That My Passion Is Fashion Designing. <br />
                    I Have worked In The Fashion World For Almost 10 Years.<br />
                    I Have Sewn Since I Can Remember Myself.</p>
                     <p style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS'; font-size:34px; font-style:italic;  line-height: 1.5;">
                    I Started My company In 2019 With The Desire To Make Couture Dresses Accessible To Everyone By Selling Them For Cheaper.<br />
                    I Know How It Might Sound...<br />
                    Cheaper Dresses? Must Be Low Quality...<br />
                    Well I Am Here To Tell You That It Is Not True!<br />
                    All The Dresses Are Sewn By My Team And I, A Lot Of Time Is Invested In The Making Of each Dress And All The Dresses Are Made With High Quality Fabrics.<br />
                </p>
